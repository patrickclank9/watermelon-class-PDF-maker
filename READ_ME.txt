In the project directory:
- Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies
- Run the project with 'node watermelon.js'

It will create 3 folders:
- All_Class_Schedules
- All_Prof_Schedules
- All_Tab_Schedules
All populated with different pdf schedules.

Class/Professor colors and Tab Schedules can be configured in config.json
If you want to change the classes to render, it is currently looking for a file 
called 'CS_Courses_2197_Schd_Dept_Stu_Views.json'
That must be changed in code if you want a different semester to be rendered.

Thank you for all your help
